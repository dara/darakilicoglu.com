In 2006, I attempted to write a web framework in PHP with a database adapter called POG, mostly as an exercise. It worked fine, but I had to write hundreds of lines of code every time I created a new application and thousands more to make it functional. My framework looked more like the International Space Station than a proper web framework.

A year later, my longtime collaborator and friend Burak Arikan demonstrated Rails to me. It was a revelation. The features it packed in 2007 were truly groundbreaking. I picked it up quickly and built a successful career around it as a non-developer.

During the Javascript renaissance, when many developers flocked to JS frameworks, particularly React, I felt lonely. I never thought Rails was slow or anything, I guess it's because none of my projects were at the scale of Facebook's. I thought I didn't need the speed of those "frighteningly fast" Javascript frameworks.

Now, two decades later, it is heartening to see people are returning from Javascript-heavy stacks to Rails. The framework has evolved to include powerful front-end rendering capabilities while maintaining its productivity-boosting foundation. The recent release of Rails 8 marks another milestone, offering unprecedented deployment flexibility: we are no longer tied to platforms like Heroku.

Over the past few months, I have built numerous applications, from small proof-of-concepts to production-ready systems, using various frameworks to evaluate different technology stacks. This experience has solidified my conviction that Rails is still the best for entrepreneurs, solo-founders, or anyone with a side project idea.

This isn't just because of its technical merits. Rails has always attracted pragmatic builders who prioritize getting things done. It has evolved with that mindset. The community is amazing because folks are more interested in creating valuable products than engaging in endless technical debates.

<h2 class="title-3 mb-2">It's secure</h2>

A few months ago, while building my booking app Buki with Next.js (mainly for "Pair with Dara" sessions), the project became unnecessarily complex, even for basic features like database tables and user authentication. During pre-launch security checks, I discovered serious issues that delayed the launch by a week. These would never have been concerns with Rails, which prioritizes security out of the box.

It is certainly possible to bootstrap a successful software business with any technology stack. But the prevalence of Rails-based applications in successful businesses is no coincidence. After two decades of evolution, Rails continues to offer the perfect balance of productivity, security, and maintainability. I believe it will be one of the most compelling choices in 2025.
