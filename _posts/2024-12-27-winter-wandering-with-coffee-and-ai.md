Walking through winter streets with a coffee in hand and brainstorming with ChatGPT has turned quiet afternoons into productive ones. During a recent visit to Coffee Collective, I sketched out data models and mapped my next business idea using the ChatGPT iOS app.

The holidays are such a good time to step out of routines and try something new, even if it's just during small pockets of free time. ChatGPT's voice chat has been a fantastic way to stay mobile and get things done while staying relaxed. A friend told me it sometimes struggles with her pronunciation, so I suggested she try it in her own language instead.

If you've been waiting for the right moment to start a project or explore a fresh idea, let this holiday season be your spark. Chat-first business design might be just what you need to get started.

I'm also excited to share that the Pair with Dara sessions have been incredibly energizing. So much so that I've decided to host more next year. On top of that, I'm working on a new on-demand product service for founders and business owners, stay tuned for updates.

Wishing you a joyful holiday season and a bright, creative new year ahead! âœ¨ðŸŽ„
