    <h1 class="title-3 mb-2">Exploring coffee flavor structures</h1>
    <p>The world of coffee offers a symphony of flavors, from the bright acidity of a Kenyan single-origin to the rich chocolatey notes of a Sumatran roast. Flavor Tree, an interactive tool built upon the <a href="https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/resources/sensory-lexicon" class="text-link">World Coffee Research</a>'s lexicon, offers a comprehensive and accessible way to navigate this nuanced flavor landscape.</p>

    <h2 class="title-3 mb-2">Challenge: Beyond the static wheel</h2>
    <p>For coffee enthusiasts, the quest to understand and appreciate the intricate flavors of their favorite beverage is an ongoing journey. A longstanding tool in this pursuit has been the <a href="https://sca.coffee/research/coffee-tasters-flavor-wheel" class="text-link">Coffee Flavor Wheel</a>, a beautiful static image developed by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) in 1995. The wheel effectively categorizes a wide range of coffee taste profiles, from fruity and floral to nutty and spicy.</p>
    <p>However, the Coffee Flavor Wheel's strength as a reference chart also presents limitations. Its sunburst diagram format can be cumbersome to navigate, particularly on mobile devices. The static nature of the wheel hinders the ability to explore the relationships and nuances between flavors in an interactive way. This poses a challenge for coffee enthusiasts who want to delve deeper into their coffee experience on the go.</p>

<div class="text-block">
    <h2 class="title-3 mb-2">Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>Flavor Tree addresses sunburst's limitation by translating the lexicon into an interactive mobile application, utilizing an icicle-like visualization, the space-filling equivalent to a sunburst chart, to represent the cumulative relationships between coffee flavors in a clear and intuitive manner.</p>
