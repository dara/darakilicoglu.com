    <h1 class="title-1 mb-2">Uniting creatives and businesses</h1>
    <p>Neol is an innovative hub where companies can find and collaborate with talented professionals from various creative fields, facilitating projects that require unique and tailored solutions. I helped design the platform, focusing on creating impactful member profiles that highlight the exceptional abilities of the creative leaders.</p>

    <h2 class="title-3 mb-2">Approach</h2>
    <p>It was essential to highlight each creative's unique strengths, experiences, and portfolio in a way that was both visually appealing and easily navigable. By doing so, we aimed to make it straightforward for businesses to identify and connect with the right professionals for their projects, ultimately facilitating more successful collaborations.</p>

    <p>We prioritized capturing a comprehensive picture of each creative leader by collecting detailed information on their goals, expertise, passions, skills, offerings (a clear description of services provided by each creative leader), and social links.</p>
    <p>This data was crucial for Neol's AI systems to learn from, enabling the platform to make informed collaboration suggestions and build teams based on the backgrounds and strengths of the individuals. To minimize the registration burden, a simple form structure was implemented, ensuring ease of use while gathering all necessary information.</p>

<div class="text-block">
    <h2 class="title-3 mb-2">Neol Shapes</h2>
    <p>In addition to the core profile information, we introduced a fun and interactive element called "Neol Shapes." This was a shape generator tool that allowed members to create unique, data-driven shapes based on their profile information.</p>

    <h2 class="title-3 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The design process emphasized creating informative yet streamlined member profiles. This solution aimed to empower creative leaders to stand out while making their skills easily discoverable by businesses seeking the right talent for their projects. The focus on passions played a key role in fostering connections beyond just skills, fostering a vibrant and engaging creative community within Neol's platform. Neol Shapes added a playful element, allowing members to express themselves visually and further personalize their profiles.</p>
    <h2 class="title-3 mt-16 mb-2">Looking forward</h2>
    <p>While the initial focus on manual curation necessitated collecting a comprehensive set of information upfront, a future iteration could explore a progressive profile building approach. This would allow members to start with a core set of details and gradually add more information over time.</p>
    <p>Currently, profiles showcase individual achievements. In the future, Neol could explore ways to visually represent collaborations on projects. Perhaps a "face pile" or a similar element could be implemented to highlight teamwork and connections.</p>
