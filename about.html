        <p>
            I'm a product designer based in Copenhagen. I strive to create designs that bring value to people's lives, help businesses thrive, and contribute positively to society. My goal is to find the sweet spot where thoughtful design can serve these interconnected needs, working alongside teams and users to craft solutions that matter.
